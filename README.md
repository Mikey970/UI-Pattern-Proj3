# UI-Pattern-Proj3
This project uses an API and Tab interface to display different Cryptocurrency information.
# Description
Upon loading the page the tab titles are fetched from the coin gecko API. Whatever tab is clicked on a fetch request is made to retrive the details of that coin. The Description is then updated with the retrived information, including the price, title and description. The selected tab will remain highlighted until another tab is clicked.
